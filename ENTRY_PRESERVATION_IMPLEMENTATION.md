# Entry Preservation System Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This implementation ensures that user game entries are **invisibly preserved** throughout the signup and email confirmation process. Users can place bets, sign up, confirm their email, and have their entries automatically restored and submitted without any data loss.

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

### 1. **Anonymous Game Play**
- User visits competition page (no login required)
- Places 5 bets/entries on the game
- Clicks "CHECKOUT" button

### 2. **Checkout & Signup Redirect**
- System preserves entries using multiple storage mechanisms
- User redirected to `/signup` page
- Entries associated with email during signup process

### 3. **Email Confirmation**
- User receives confirmation email
- Clicks confirmation link
- System automatically migrates temporary entries to permanent storage
- User redirected to checkout (if entries exist) or home page

### 4. **Automatic Entry Restoration**
- Entries are seamlessly restored in checkout
- User can complete purchase without re-entering bets
- All coordinate data preserved exactly as placed

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **Entry Preservation Manager** (`src/lib/entry-preservation.ts`)
- **Multiple Storage Layers**: localStorage, sessionStorage, and database backup
- **Session Tracking**: Unique session IDs for anonymous users
- **Email Association**: Links entries to user email during signup
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Expires entries after 24 hours

#### 2. **Database Schema** (`supabase-temp-entries-migration.sql`)
```sql
CREATE TABLE temp_entries (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    competition_id UUID REFERENCES competitions(id),
    entries_data JSONB NOT NULL, -- Game coordinates
    user_email TEXT,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

#### 3. **Integration Points**
- **Play Page**: Saves entries with preservation system
- **Checkout Page**: Loads from preservation system with fallbacks
- **Signup Page**: Associates entries with user email
- **Auth Callback**: Migrates temporary to permanent entries
- **Success Page**: Shows entry preservation status

### Storage Strategy

#### **Primary Storage** (localStorage)
```javascript
{
  sessionId: "session_1704123456_abc123",
  competitionId: "uuid-123",
  competitionTitle: "Win a PlayStation 5",
  entries: [
    { id: "entry-1", x: 45.2, y: 67.8, timestamp: 1704123456 },
    { id: "entry-2", x: 52.1, y: 43.9, timestamp: 1704123457 }
  ],
  userEmail: "user@example.com", // Set during signup
  createdAt: 1704123456
}
```

#### **Secondary Storage** (sessionStorage)
- Identical format as primary storage
- Survives page refreshes but not browser restarts
- Fallback if localStorage fails

#### **Database Backup** (temp_entries table)
- Stores entries in database during signup process
- Survives browser crashes and device changes
- Automatically cleaned up after 24 hours

### Migration Process

#### **During Email Confirmation**
```javascript
// 1. Load temp entries by email
const tempEntries = await loadTempEntriesFromDB(userEmail)

// 2. Convert to permanent entries
const permanentEntries = tempEntries.map(entry => ({
  competition_id: entry.competition_id,
  user_id: confirmedUserId,
  guess_x: entry.x,
  guess_y: entry.y,
  entry_price_paid: entry.entry_price
}))

// 3. Save to competition_entries table
await supabase.from('competition_entries').insert(permanentEntries)

// 4. Clean up temporary entries
await supabase.from('temp_entries').delete().eq('user_email', userEmail)
```

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- **No Sensitive Data**: Only game coordinates and competition info stored
- **Automatic Expiration**: All temporary data expires in 24 hours
- **Session Isolation**: Each session has unique identifier
- **RLS Policies**: Database-level security for temp entries

### Privacy Compliance
- **Minimal Data**: Only essential game data preserved
- **User Consent**: Implicit consent through game participation
- **Data Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of expired entries
- **No Tracking**: Session IDs are not used for user tracking

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. **Database Migration**
```bash
# Run the SQL migration
psql -h your-supabase-host -d postgres -f supabase-temp-entries-migration.sql
```

### 2. **Environment Setup**
- No additional environment variables required
- Uses existing Supabase configuration

### 3. **Testing Checklist**
- [ ] Anonymous user can place entries
- [ ] Entries preserved during signup
- [ ] Email confirmation migrates entries
- [ ] Checkout loads preserved entries
- [ ] Expired entries are cleaned up
- [ ] Multiple storage fallbacks work

## 🎯 User Experience Benefits

### **Seamless Flow**
- No data loss during signup process
- No need to re-enter game coordinates
- Automatic restoration after email confirmation

### **Reliability**
- Multiple storage mechanisms prevent data loss
- Works across browser restarts and device changes
- Graceful fallbacks if primary storage fails

### **Transparency**
- User sees confirmation that entries are preserved
- Clear messaging about what happens next
- No hidden processes or data handling

## 🔧 Monitoring & Maintenance

### **Logging**
- All preservation actions logged to console
- Success/failure status for each storage mechanism
- Migration status during email confirmation

### **Cleanup**
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries (24 hours)
- Manual cleanup function available: `cleanup_expired_temp_entries()`
- Storage usage monitoring recommended

### **Error Handling**
- Graceful degradation if storage mechanisms fail
- User notification if critical errors occur
- Fallback to manual entry if all systems fail

## 📊 Performance Impact

### **Storage Usage**
- ~1KB per set of entries (5 coordinates + metadata)
- Automatic cleanup prevents storage bloat
- Minimal database impact with proper indexing

### **Network Requests**
- One additional database write during signup
- One migration query during email confirmation
- No impact on game performance

## 🎉 Success Metrics

### **Data Preservation Rate**
- Target: 99.9% of entries preserved through signup
- Measurement: Compare entries placed vs. entries restored
- Fallback success rate monitoring

### **User Completion Rate**
- Expected increase in signup-to-purchase conversion
- Reduced abandonment during email confirmation
- Improved user satisfaction scores

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Database Migration Required**: Run the SQL migration before deploying
2. **Testing Essential**: Test complete flow in staging environment
3. **Monitor Storage**: Watch for storage usage and cleanup effectiveness
4. **User Communication**: Ensure users understand their entries are preserved

This implementation provides a robust, user-friendly solution that maintains game entry data throughout the entire signup and confirmation process, significantly improving the user experience and reducing abandonment rates.
